## Welcome

This `bind.link` project is a collection of low-level environment APIs,
such as those for JavaScript, Node.js, Rust, Swift, etc.. They are
simply the type definitions for most of the useful features of the
environment, for use in code. We use them to generate the appropriate
environment code in the `base.link` compiler. In addition, it has the
base types used by the environments, such as `any` and `text`.
